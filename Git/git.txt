If You Use a Passphrase
If you enter a passphrase, you'll need to unlock the key every time you use Git. You can make this easier by caching it:

sh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
This stores your passphrase in memory, so you donâ€™t have to enter it repeatedly.

FAQ
ðŸ”¹ What does -u origin main do?
It sets up a tracking connection between your local main branch and the remote main branch on GitHub.
After this, when you run git push or git pull, Git knows which remote branch to sync with by default.
After running git push -u origin main once, you can simply use git push for future updates.


ðŸ›  What Happens Here?
git branch -M main  # Renames the current branch to 'main'
By default, Git used to name the first branch master. However, many repositories now use main as the default branch instead.
git branch -M main  # Renames the current branch to 'main'
This ensures your main development branch is named main, not master or something else.
If GitHub expects a main branch and yours is named master, GitHub wonâ€™t recognize it, and pushing will fail.
After renaming your branch, you push it with:
git push -u origin main
